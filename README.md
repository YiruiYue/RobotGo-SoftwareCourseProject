RobotGo -- a turn based computer game.

Part 1: what is the project RobotGo?

RobotGo was a team project I contributed and finished at University of Saskatchewan in my third year class Software Engineering. Following principles and techniques for developing software, our team aimed to develop a small computer game. The game, implemented in Java and Forth, is a turn based robot battle game. It requires the players to use some thoughtful strategies in order to defeat another player which can be a human or a computer.

This is the snapshot showing the game mode selection:

Part 2: what’s been done to accomplish the project?

The following steps were accomplished in order.

1.	Requirements Document. Thoroughly examined the needs of the client (our professor in this case) and came up with the requirement document.
•	Identification of actors and actions.
•	Uses cases to illustrate scenarios for each action.
•	System diagram.

2.	Design Document. Carefully decided on the optimum architecture and created the design document. 
•	Model View Controller with some aspects of independent components integrated.
•	UML class Diagram for the whole project.
•	Definition of the classes and functions involved. 
•	Use of the Class Responsibility Collaboration Card. 
•	Changes made to the previous requirement document.
  
3.	Test Plan. Thoroughly went through the requirement document and design document to create the test plan, meanwhile to re-examine the current project.
•	Unit test.
•	Functional test.
•	Integration & Component test.
•	System test.
•	Changes made to the earlier design.

4.	Code construction based on previous design.
•	Pair Programing.
•	Code Review.
•	Changes documentation.

5.	Project experience summary. 
•	Game showcase to professor and class.
•	User’s manual to help non-programmer to launch the game and play. 
•	Programmer’s manual to guide the next programmer in maintaining or extending our system.
•	Delta document includes the unfulfilled requirements and bugs remain.

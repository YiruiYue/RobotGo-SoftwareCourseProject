We have chosen the model view controller architecture as the main structure for our project. Because of this all of the intelligence of the code is concentrated in the classes of our controllers. The controller has interactions with the model and the view. In our testing plan we have included unit and functional tests of the controller methods. We also have made tests in the interfaces between the controller and the model and the view. Another area of testing in our project is the interpreter. Because of the complexity of the function of the interpreter we have decided that it was necessesary to test this component as well. We have made unit and function tests for the interpreter as well as tests for the places the interpreter interfaces with the rest of the system. We have made some changes our design and these changes are enumerated at the back of our document.

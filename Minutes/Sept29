Round table discussion of use case scenarios that we all came up with. 
This included interface brainstorming, connections between actions, 
logic checking and a discussion over a misunderstanding of game rules (my bad guys, sorry)

Agreed to combine scenarios into a full draft of Requirements document, finish scenario diagrams,
and meet again tomorrow (sept 30) to finalize systems diagram and interfaces together.
